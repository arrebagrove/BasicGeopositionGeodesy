# BasicGeopositionGeodesy
A C# extension method class for the BasicGeoposition class, containing geodesy methods. This code is based upon my GeodesicLibrary repo (https://github.com/marknotgeorge/GeodesicLibrary), which in turn is a port of Javascript functions written by Chris Veness (http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html and on GitHub at https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy). The difference between this library and GeodesicLibrary is that this library uses the BasicGeoposition rather than a custom Position class. This class also uses the metre as the unit of length, which in turn means it is not dependent upon the Units.Net library.
